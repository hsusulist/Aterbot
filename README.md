# Overview Afksrbot

AFKsrbot or AFKserverbot is a 24/7 Minecraft AFK bot designed to maintain a persistent presence on a Minecraft server. The bot automatically connects to a specified server, handles authentication through the AuthMe plugin, and keeps the connection alive to prevent idle disconnections. It includes a simple web server for status monitoring and automatic reconnection capabilities for maintaining uptime.
